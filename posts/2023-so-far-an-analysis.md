# 2023 So Far - An Analysis
## Tl;dr
An analysis of how 2023 is going so far, from a technology and personal point of view.

## Day 111
_111 what's your not-an-emergency?_

21st of April 2023, the 111th day of the year.

Wow, _time is flying_ and here we are: almost at the end of the 4th month of the year.

If we want to be precise, we are at the 30.41% of the year.

I always find fascinating how much effort humanity puts into time.

Time calculations, time management, time consumption, time saving, _time this_, _time that_.

> Time is the invisible log of our lives.

I honestly prefer _thyme_: it's a lovely herb that you can use for cooking, for example with potatoes.

Yes, talking again about recipes. And guess what? You need to _time_ your potatoes seasoned with _tyhme_.

You don't want them too hard or too soft.

_OK, I get that. Time is important. Great. So what?_

> Well, actually time is just a way of measuring the distance between 2 or more facts.

I hope I am not responsible for changing the law of physics with the above statement.

What I am trying to say is that time is important, but definitely less than facts.

Actions, meetings, events. That's what really matters.

Please, allow me to take out the _time variable_ from the equation of this [weird] article.

I would like to start this analysis from a series of considerations about what happened in the technology field.

Then, I will move into my personal/professional life.

Are you still there?

## Technology and Emotions
There is a bunch of interesting stuff happened so far in the technology landscape.

Some of that stuff is hype, some is more defined, some is definitely promising tech.

### Rust
I am currently learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It seems a great System Programming language.

I am quite excited about it, but there's something that really touched me.

The [Rust Foundation](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/)
released a very confusing [draft](https://twitter.com/rust_foundation/status/1644132378858729474) of the new policy.

A lot of developers tweeted badly about the ideas proposed by the Rust Foundation,
because the written words seemed to explain that it's not possible anymore to use the _Rust_ word (being a trademark)
in content created without the permission of the Foundation.
For example, a YouTube video or a blog article dedicated to Rust.

Luckily, the [Rust Foundation](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/rust-trademark-policy-draft-revision-next-steps/)
seems to have started listening to the angry voices of programmers all over the Internet.

I didn't have a chance to read the full document, so I really can't tell how much it was misleading.

But the fact that so many Rust enthusiasts were affected _means something_.

> It means that you can't play tricks with a passionate community.

A community that helped Rust to become a loved language doesn't deserve to be treated just as end users.

Passion is a driving force in a community, and it can determine what will be the future of a cool piece of technology.

> Yes, we can build as much technology we want, but we are still humans.

And everything that limits our creativity or our ability to promote great things will eventually become _wrong_
in our minds and hearts.

I personally think that the Rust Foundation learned a lot from this mistake:
* it's necessary to involve the community from the beginning of every kind of policy draft
* once filtered from drama, the direct and harsh feedback is carrying value
* emotions still matter
* transparency is good, but it requires the right communication skills and planning

Anyway, I believe in Rust and I am looking forward to build great products with it.

### SpaceX
At the moment, I don't have a strong opinion about Elon Musk, although I tend to admire his entrepreneurial spirit.

> I mean, if I have to choose a tech person to take inspiration from, I would probably choose John Carmack.

If you don't know John, well you can watch [this _short_ interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I845O57ZSy4).

And John surprised me when
he declared that [he was participating](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1649049780772040710?s=20)
at the first SpaceX's _Starship_ launch.

Who knows what John is up to? He is my hero.

Anyway, I was talking about Elon and then I got distracted. 

Yes, I don't care a lot about Elon, but I care more about SpaceX.

I think that SpaceX is a company that is capable of connecting people across the globe for a common goal:
move heavy stuff into the space with new - often bizarre but still amazing - engineering tools.

Launching a big rocket is a big deal.

Tons of special materials, fuel and human knowledge are pushed into the sky, trying to win gravity.

Humans already did unbelievable things with aerospace technology.

> But SpaceX has something more, something different.

Probably it's able to poke our childhood curiosity, motivating even non-STEM people to get excited about going into space.

At the end, a lot of companies and governments go into space.

But my impression is that only SpaceX is capable of convincing people around the world to look up in the sky.

> Only SpaceX allows humans to enjoy the process of going out of our planet.

So, inspired by SpaceX, what are you going to launch soon?

### AI
I am not going to mention the tool from OpenAI that everybody talked about.

Yes, I've tried it and did a bit of work with that.

I also tried the Google competitor and some generative AI tools for images and videos.

Here is my honest analysis, as a software engineer - not as an AI or Machine Learning expert:
* Generative AI is a nice tool, but it has limits, like every tool. So, avoid to be extremely dependent on it
* There's too much hype around AI, pumped by billions of investments. Hype is dangerous from a technology point of view
* AI is a powerful technology that has undefined consequences,
so it needs a proper regulation and a compliance entity, something similar to what already happens with nuclear energy
* _Large Language Models_ (LLMs) are becoming bigger and bigger, requiring a huge amount of computational power
* Software Engineers will not be replaced by AI
  * A programmer like me still has to deal with all the _necessary noise_ around code
  * _Necessary noise_ is everything regarding software enginnering, but code.
    * For example: architectural decisions, customer needs, documentation, collaboration, discussions, etc
  * Even if AI will write tons of amazing code,
dealing with the unrecorded complexity is really difficult for something that still requires a kind of input
* AI can help humanity to solve problems and chase new fascinating challenges,
we can't waste the opportunity to do something better for us - humans - not for machines

> It's time to leave the hype behind and seriously start considering AI for what it is and what it could be.

## A Bit About Me
My 2023 has been _generative_ so far:
* Officially co-founded [Umbria Green Heart Ltd](https://umbriagreenheart.co.uk/), a UK-based deli food/wine startup
* Appointed as director of another startup that wants to innovate office and work furniture
  * I will provide more details about this in the next weeks or months
* Started tweeting again, allowing me to virtually meet great people across the globe
* Becoming a father of a little girl, I am so proud of her mother and her
* Re-started training regularly
* Launched my voice on the Internet, don't know if it will be a podcast or something like a series of video

I am quite sure that this year will bring more interesting stuff in my life.

> I am also sure that I will never stop building something new, something better.

Let's hurl new challenges at the stars!
