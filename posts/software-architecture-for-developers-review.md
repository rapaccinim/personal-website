# Software Architecture for Web Developers - Review
## Tl;dr
A light and useful _knowledge backpack_ for your professional journey.

## Overview
As a Senior Software Engineer, sometime I found myself a bit lost with all the technical terms regarding software architecture and Architect-like roles.
I already had a good understanding of architectural patterns, but I felt like I was missing the _big picture_ in order to comprehend important aspects, for example the difference between design and architecture.

_Software Architecture for Web Developers_ is a good summary of the basic concepts that are necessary to know in order to approach Software Architecture:
it provides the necessary keys to open the _doors_ to new paths, some of them totally unexpected.

I really enjoyed Chapter 7 about soft skills because I think that they are often underestimated:
we are humans and we need good interaction in order to reach something together.

Even if you are not considering to apply for an Architect-role promotion, this little book will give you a light and useful _knowledge backpack_:
use it wisely, it will help you with your professional journey!

## Review
### Chapter 1 - The Role of Architecture
A general introduction to what is _architecture_ and how it impacts software products, considering the stakeholders.

### Chapter 2 - Diving into Some Common Architectural Patterns
I personally already knew about the architectural patterns mentioned here,
but this chapter offers a good overview if you do not know about them:
* _Layered Pattern_
* _Client-Server Pattern_
* _MVC Pattern_
* _Microservices Pattern_
* _CQRS Pattern_
* Some UI Patterns:
  * _Microfrontends_
  * _Flux_
  * _Jamstack_

### Chapter 3 - Myths about Architecture
This is probably one of the best chapters in my opinion, because it removed a lot of the _fog_ I had in my brain about
architecture before reading this book.

Copy-pasting here a great quote from this chapter:
> Architecture is not about forgetting implementation details and getting drowned in abstractions,
> but about keeping them balanced

### Chapter 4 - Discussing What Good Architecture is
I personally don't know enough to technically review this chapter,
but here I found what I consider a nice checklist for starting to define _what good means_ when talking about architecture.

### Chapter 5 - Design vs Architecture
Initially, in my mind the definitions of _Design_ and _Architecture_ were interchangeable.

That is not correct, since there are some theoretical and practical differences that this chapter explains in a brief and incisive way.

### Chapter 6 - Types of Architects and Their Focus
Do you know what the following Architect-related roles are responsible for?
* _Enterprise Architect_
* _System Architect_
* _Software Architect_
* _Solution Architect_
* _Application Architect_

### Chapter 7 - Leveraging Soft Skills
Probably my favourite chapter because soft skills are more than necessary to work together in an efficient and natural way.

Here I learned about the _OODA_ (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) loop for decisions and risk management.

### Chapter 8 - Who Codes and Who 'Architects'?
Short chapter that can be summarised by this quote:
> as a programmer, your constant focus is on details, while architects focus most of their time on the whole picture

### Chapter 9 - Break the Rules
The end, with 1 word stuck in my mind:
* _craftsman_
  * I am not a big fan of Agile, but _craftsmanship_ probably is the word that describes better what _working on software_ is,
compared to the more generic _engineering_
